# UNIX Assignment

* I got overzealous with the folders - source and intermediate files are located in /UNIX_Assignment, along with README_WAB.md - this file contains the data inspection and processing information for the assignment. As mentioned in that file, the 44 result files are located in /UNIX_Assignment/Result_Files/ to keep them organized separately from the intermediate files.
